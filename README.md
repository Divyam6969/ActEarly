# Project ActEarly

**Project ActEarly** is a comprehensive child development milestone tracker app designed to help caregivers monitor and track the progress of children's developmental milestones. This app was developed using Flutterflow during the Mitacs Globalink Research Internship by Divyam Malik.
<br>


## Overview

Project ActEarly allows multiple caregivers to collaboratively track the development of a child by using an innovative ActEarly ID feature. The app supports both cloud and local storage options, ensuring data privacy and security, especially for users in Canada. It offers a user-friendly interface with an attractive flippable carousel and a chatbot powered by the Gemini API to answer questions related to child development milestones.

## Features

### 1. **Privacy-Focused Storage Options**
   - **Cloud Storage**: Data is stored securely on a cloud server located in Montreal, Canada, complying with Canadian data privacy and security regulations.
   - **Local Storage**: Users can opt to store data locally on their device, ensuring no data leaves the device unless explicitly chosen.

### 2. **ActEarly ID for Shared Access**
   - **Multiple Caregivers**: Different caregivers (e.g., parents, grandparents, nannies) can track the same child's progress by entering the ActEarly ID.
   - **Shared Access**: Available only when using cloud storage. Local storage does not support shared access.
   - **Switching Storage**: Only the parent who registered the child can switch between cloud and local storage.

### 3. **Comprehensive Milestone Tracking**
   - **Types of Milestones**: Track fine motor skills, gross motor skills, social/language development, and cognitive milestones.
   - **Trusted Data Sources**: Milestone data is sourced from reliable Canadian government websites:
     - [Your Child's Development - Caring for Kids](https://caringforkids.cps.ca/handouts/behavior-and-development/your_childs_development)
     - [Rourke Baby Record](https://www.rourkebabyrecord.ca/walk4#veg66)

### 4. **User Interface**
   - **Flippable Carousel**: The home page features a flippable carousel with AI-generated images illustrating child development milestones.
   - **Chatbot Feature**: Powered by the Gemini API, the chatbot answers questions related to childhood development milestones.
