# Project ActEarly  

**Project ActEarly**  is a children’s milestone tracker app developed using FlutterFlow during the Mitacs Globalink Research Internship by Divyam Malik. The motivation behind ActEarly is to provide healthcare professionals and caregivers with an efficient tool for tracking developmental milestones in children, ensuring adherence to Canadian data privacy and security standards. The app offers dual storage options, allowing users to store data locally or in the cloud, with the cloud server located in Montreal, Canada, to address privacy concerns. One of the unique features of ActEarly is the ActEarly ID, which enables multiple caregivers, such as parents, grandparents, and nannies, to collaboratively track the same child’s milestones. This shared access feature is exclusive to cloud storage users. Additionally, only the parent who registered the child can switch between local and cloud storage, ensuring controlled data management. ActEarly monitors various developmental milestones, including fine motor, gross motor, social/language, and cognitive milestones, using data from reputable Canadian government sources. The app also includes a visually engaging flippable carouselon the homepage, featuring AI-generated images to illustrate milestones. Furthermore, ActEarly integrates a chatbot powere by the Gemini API to provide users with instant answers to questions related to child development milestones.This [Document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S9yNptzwJg7vqaT-6dPjr89ymrSGNhkU/view?usp=sharing)
